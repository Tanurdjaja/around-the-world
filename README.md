          One of the more popular tourist cities is San Francisco. Take a drive through Lombard Street, the street may be crowded, but there's a beautiful sight and many fun turns.        </p>

          Want to take a break from the iconic Lombard Street or Golden Gate Bridge? Enjoy art? Then you should definitely walk on the 16th Avenue tiled staircase! These are beautiful mosaics that piece together a lovely image.

    <p>Another interesting place to check out are the Painted Ladies, which were named so because of the different colors that each house was painted. These houses make for an unusual sight, but a splendid photo. You can also rest on the hills opposite of these houses and just enjoy the view. </p>
